Extensions:
Procedural Generation
KeyboardEvent handling
Regular Expressions (regexp) for splitting strings with multiple separators
.filter and .split for handling strings and putting them in arrays.
Inheritance for Player, Enemy entities.
Cool 2D array of Cell class for the map! I can get fun properties now.
Async/await for asynchronous tasks.

TO-DO:
-Fix canvas size.                                                                               DONE
-MapGenerator should only check adjacent tiles. Corners don't count.                            DONE
-Update player's attack damage (cooldown?) and parry cd/duration after they die.                DONE
-Might want to put all my util functions in a util.js so i don't load every time.               DONE
-Maybe keep track of Wishes earned, enemies killed, etc? Shouldn't be hard.                         COSMETIC.
-Maybe also randomize encounterWin dialogue.                                                        COSMETIC.
-FIX FADE. FOR SOME REASON, BOSS'S FADE DIALOGUE FLASHES.                                       DONE (await delay after fade was too short, began to overlap.)
-Restructure the dialogueSequenceMoves in keyDownHandler to use game.dialogueSequenceMoves[].
-Do some testing about player.attack. Make sure player.action doesn't do stupid stuff.
-Check CSS stuff on different displays.                                                         done? idk if i actually fixed it.
- Game breaks after more deaths happen. Minimum amount of stats on Masquerade?                  DONE Made new algs.
- Make a new .txt with all the enemies and item stats?
- sometimes, attack will just stop for no reason.                                                   PRIORITY

    - Array with all item IDs? I'm not sure, but keeping track of them is going to be hard.

Some decisions to be made:
- Control scheme? Keyboard or mouse?
- Hide room tiers?
    - Need to investigate to find out what they are?
    - Escape option?
- Change enemies to reflect people more? Old mentions of vices can be revealed after conflict.
- Where does shop show up? Center or end of stage?
    - how many stages?
- Items?
    - health pot.
    - Talismen?
- Should SEEKER even be able to die? Or is the ending just real bad?
    - I think SEEKER should be able to die.

General planning:
- Dungeon crawler progesses through some number of rooms.
- Game dictated by Masquerade value. Player gains Masquerade upon death.
    - The world is a tough place. Even if SEEKER wants to drive away the vices, they sometimes harm them.
        - Masquerade is a measure of the defenses SEEKER puts up.
    - As Masquerade increases:
        - SEEKER's combat potential is increased.
        - Each level:
           - Health increases by 3 points.
           - ATK increases by 2 points.
    - Masquerade decreased by:
        - Spending Wishes
        - End-of-room shop?????

To-Do:
- See class CELL for some ideas about cell.name!
- Maybe globalUtilityScript is actually a main.js thing. Move class GAME to main.js, to start.
- Check which vars in class GAME actually matter. Also name them better.
    - check if need var to track moves since last battle.


Some ideas about attack effects.
- Stun
- Bleed
- Thorn Armor (buff)

some attacks are not attacks at all, but pure buffs or debuffs.
0 basedamage, 0 channelling
